# Temporal Graph Representation Learning with PyTorch
This repository demonstrates how to extend a static Graph Representation Learning model to incorporate temporal data using PyTorch. The project combines a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for node embeddings with a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) to capture temporal evolution in a sequence of graph snapshots. The model is designed to predict link formations over time in dynamic knowledge graphs.

Key Features:
* GCN-based node embeddings for graph structure learning.
* LSTM to model temporal changes in node relationships.
* Support for time-based graph snapshots and link prediction.
* Example code for training and handling temporal graph data.
