"""
Temporal Graph Representation Learning with PyTorch

Author: Daniel Miskell
Note: This script is a high-level illustration of incorporating a temporal component into 
a static Graph Representation Learning model. The code combines a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) 
for node embeddings with a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) to capture temporal evolution across 
graph snapshots and predict link formations over time.

Warning: This script is intended as pseudocode and was largely assisted by generative AI. 
It serves as a conceptual framework and may require significant adjustments for real-world implementation, 
such as handling dynamic graph structures, data loading, and computational optimizations.

Key Components:
- GCN-based node embeddings for each graph snapshot.
- LSTM to model temporal dynamics of node embeddings.
- Example code for training and handling temporal data in knowledge graphs.
